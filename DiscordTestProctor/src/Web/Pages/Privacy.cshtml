        Janus Proctor Console helps Discord communities administer certifications and exams. We only
        collect data needed to operate the service and maintain auditability for exam outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we store</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Discord guild identifiers and names to connect exams to a server.</li>
        <li>Discord user identifiers and display names for exam sessions.</li>
        <li>Certification, question, and result data created by administrators.</li>
        <li>Operational telemetry such as timestamps and sync activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use data</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Deliver certifications, exams, and role assignments.</li>
        <li>Provide audit trails for administrators in the dashboard.</li>
        <li>Improve reliability, security, and support experiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
        Data remains in the configured database until administrators remove certifications, results,
        or disconnect the bot from a guild. You control the infrastructure when self-hosting.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell data. Data is only shared with Discord as required to fulfill commands and
        role assignments. Self-hosted deployments keep data within your infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
        If you need assistance or want data removed, contact your deployment administrator or open
        a support request in the repository.
