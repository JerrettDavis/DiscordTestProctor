Janus Proctor Console helps Discord communities administer certifications and exams. We only collect data needed to operate the service and maintain auditability for exam outcomes.

## Information we store
- Discord guild identifiers and names to connect exams to a server.
- Discord user identifiers and display names for exam sessions.
- Certification, question, and result data created by administrators.
- Operational telemetry such as timestamps and sync activity.

## How we use data
- Deliver certifications, exams, and role assignments.
- Provide audit trails for administrators in the dashboard.
- Improve reliability, security, and support experiences.

## Data retention
Data remains in the configured database until administrators remove certifications, results, or disconnect the bot from a guild. You control the infrastructure when self-hosting.

## Sharing
We do not sell data. Data is only shared with Discord as required to fulfill commands and role assignments. Self-hosted deployments keep data within your infrastructure.

## Contact
If you need assistance or want data removed, contact your deployment administrator or open a support request in the repository.
